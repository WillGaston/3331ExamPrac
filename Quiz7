Q1 . A router performs routing when a data packet arrives. True or False?
False - routing is part of the control plane not the data plane

Q2 . When a packet arrives, a router performs forwarding. True or False?
True

Q3 . To perform forwarding, a router needs to perform routing first. True or False?
True

Q4 . To perform forwarding, a router must inspect the source address in the arriving packet's header. True or False?
False

Q5 . IP packet fragmentation:
A. helps speed up data delivery in the Internet
B. cannot be avoided
C. can be avoided by controlling TCP segment size based on path MTU discovery <----
D. can be avoided by configuring the maximum transfer unit (MTU) of the underlying link layer.

Q6 . Each network interface of a host must be configured with an IP address. True or False?
True - IP addresses are used to identify a host

Q7 . Two hosts connected to the same subnet can reach each other without the help of a router. True or False?
True

Q8 . In the original "classful" addressing scheme, the network address part of the 32-bit IP address could have a maximum of:
A. 8 bits <--- prior to classa-e
B. 10 bits
C. 16 bits
D. 24 bits <--- (Class C)

Q9 . In today's CIDR addressing scheme, the subnet part of the 32-bit IP address:
A. can only have 24 bits
B. must be at least 8 bits long
C. can have a maximum length of 28 bits
D. can have any arbitrary length (<= 32 bit) <-----

Q10 . CIDR addressing scheme could work without the help of subnet masks. True or False?
FALSE

Q11 . How many IP addresses belong to the subnet 128.119.254.0/26?
A.16
B. 32
C. 64 <<<----
D. 128

Q12 . What are the IP addresses at the two end-points of the subnet 128.119.254.0/26?
A. 128.119.254.0 and 128.119.254.63 <<<,------
B. 128.119.254.0 and 128.119.254.128
C. 128.119.254.63 and 128.119.254.128
D. 128.119.254.0 and 128.119.254.64

Q13 . Without DHCP, a host cannot be configured with an IP address. True or False?
False - if it is not a part of a subnet and only contains a single host then DHCP is not needed

Q14 . From the IP address, one can guess the geographic location of the device. True or False?
True

Q15 . The two subnets 128.119.245.128/25 and 128.119.245.0/26 have overlapping IP addresses. True or False?
false

Q16 . One of the advantages of NAT is that the organisation can change the addresses of the devices within its local network
without notifying the outside world. True or False?
True

Q17 . NAT violates the layering principle. True or False?
True - needs to go to IP layer from link layer

Q18 . For NAT to work, we need at least two public IP addresses. True or False?
False - NAT translates public IP address + port --> private IP address + port
