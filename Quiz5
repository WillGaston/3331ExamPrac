 Q1 . TCP receiver may intentionally delay the acknowledgement of a correctly received packet. True or False?
True - if congestion

Q2 . A TCP receiver receives an in-order segment with an expected sequence number, but it has one other segment with pending ACK. Which of the following is a possible action for this receiver if it is using the delayed ACK mechanism?
A. It sends 2 ACKs one after the other
B. It sends 3 ACKs one after the other
C. It sends one cumulative ACK acknowledging both segments <====
D. It sends a Duplicate ACK.

Q3 . TCP is never allowed to retransmit unless there is a timeout. True or False?
False - fast retransmit after 3 dup ack

Q4 . During slow start, congestion window increases:
A. Linearly
B. Exponentially <===
C. Logarithmically
D. Does not grow

Q5 . Maximum segment size (MSS) refers to the number of bytes in a TCP segment including its header. True or False?
False - doesn't include header

Q6 . A TCP connection is using an MSS=1460 byte. At the start of the slow start phase, how many bytes the TCP sender can transmit without having to wait for ACK?
A.1400
B. 1460 <==
C.1500
D. 3000

Q7 . A TCP sender could still reduce its window size even if there was no triple duplicate ACK or timeout. True or False?
True
